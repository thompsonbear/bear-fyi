## About Me

**Hey folks!** My name is Thompson Bear. I'm currently working on the Support Team @ [Keyfactor](https://keyfactor.com) helping clients manage and automate the certificate lifecycle using the Keyfactor Command platform. Previously I've also done Web Development and System/Cloud Engineering. I currently live in the US with my wife and 9 "children" (3 Dogs, 2 Cats, 2 Rats, 1 Tortoise, and 1 Snake). I'm also a bit of a violinist. ðŸ˜…

## Why the Blog

For a long time I have been wanting to have a place where I can write about the things I'm working on or am passionate about. It's here! We're living in the present! I also believe that the best way to learn something new is to write about it and share it with others. And, I'll be honest, I love of learning new things, and if writing blog posts helps others learn too, all the better!

## Blog Tech Stack

This blog site is made primarily using my favorite Javascript framework: [Svelte](https://svelte.dev), as well as [MDSvex](https://mdsvex.pngwn.io/), and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The repo is open source and the code is avaliable [here](https://github.com/thompsonbear/bear-fyi). If you'd like to build a similar site for yourself, I recommend checking out Joy Of Code on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JoyofCodeDev) and their blog post [here](https://joyofcode.xyz/sveltekit-markdown-blog).

## What's In Store

I plan to start my blogging journey by writing on some simpler topics that I can more easily wrap my head around, then I'll likely start diving into some more challenging topics. I'd like to take my time with a few topics to make sure I can write some quality blog posts. Most exciting to me is to add interactive visuals to my posts to make the posts more than just words on a page. Soon, I'll be sharing the blog publicly and adding a way to sign up for notifications, but let's be honest, I'm going to need some posts first!
